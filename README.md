FL4SHK's Paint Program

This is my second attempt at making a sprite paint program, but this time
it's not geared specifically towards the GBA.

My goal with this program is to make an enhanced clone of Usenti, which is
what I've been using so far to make most of my sprites.


## Motivations
While I really like Usenti, it's not open source, so there's no simple way
to tailor it to applications besides its original intended ones.

Usenti is also a 32-bit x86 Windows program, which means it won't easily
run on other architectures.  It at least runs well in Wine, which is how
I've been able to use it.
